# Java_Poolgame

This game was built in my second year for a software design class. The assignment description was to build a game of pool. However, the main focus of the assignment was actually to gain familiarity with different design patterns, such as the factory method, builder method etc. 

It also was an opportunity to learn my way around gradle, javafx and parsing json files. 

Looking back on this, there are I could certainly have made big changes to improve the implementation(particularly the physics of the pool balls). However, as a first introduction to javafx, I am happy with it! 

Play the game using 
```
gradle build 
gradle run
```

My advice is to not pull the pool cue back very far -- a little is enough! Remember, try not to get the white ball in the hole!

Feel free to configure the config.json file to change the layout, colours, etc.
